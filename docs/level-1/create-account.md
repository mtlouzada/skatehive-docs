{% embed url="https://ipfs.skatehive.app/ipfs/QmYuM1h51bddDuC44FoAQYp9FRF2CghCncULeS4T3bp727" %}

### 1. Refer a Friend to Skatehive Using Your Account

1. **Navigate to the invite button icon** at the top of Skatehive or [click here](https://www.skatehive.app/invite).
2. **Choose their username**. Make sure they like it, as it cannot be changed easily. Type in their email address.\

3. Once you click **"Looks Good, Go For It"**, it will prompt a Keychain transaction. After you approve, the account will be created, and your friend will receive an email.

### Receive an Email Invite

Your friend will receive an email that contains their **HIVE KEYS**.\

#### Important: Keep Your Keys Safe

- **Never lose your keys!** They cannot be recovered if lost.
- Skatehive.app does not store copies of your keys for security reasons. It’s your responsibility to store them securely.

#### Logging In

Use your username and password to log in to Skatehive through any browser. However, we recommend using **Hive Keychain** for the most secure experience.

### 2. Setting Up Hive Keychain

**Hive Keychain** securely stores your private key information. It’s available as a browser extension for desktop and as a mobile app (which also serves as a web browser). Use it to log into Hive frontends, including Skatehive.

#### For Mobile Users

1. Create a PIN to unlock the keychain.
2. ![Set PIN](https://centralized-storage.example.com/images/set-pin.png)
3. After setting up the PIN, click **Use Keys/Password** and enter your **Master Password**.\

4. Log in to Skatehive by entering your **username**.\

Once the Hive Keychain approves the transaction, you’ll be logged in.

### 3. Create a Hive Account Yourself

You can also create Hive accounts (wallets) using other Hive frontends and then use those accounts to log into Skatehive.

#### Steps:

1. Make sure you have **Hive Keychain** installed.
2. Go to [HiveOnboard](https://hiveonboard.com/create-account) and create your account.
